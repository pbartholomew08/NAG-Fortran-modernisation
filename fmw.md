This is the solution for the [Fortran Modernisation Workshop](https://www.nag.co.uk/content/fortran-modernization-workshop).
The workshop exercise solves. 
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial H}{\partial t} - \kappa\frac{\partial^{2} H}{\partial x^{2}} = f(x)
\end{equation}

@Note
This is a series of Fortran workshops to help computational scientists write
efficient and portable code, and to encourage best practices in software
engineering.
